Description of the website layout:

HTML:
This code includes the HTML structure of the page with various sections and design elements. 
The website layout is made using classes for styling elements. The main elements include the 
header, main menu, main content, sections about services, "About Us" section, workflow block,
contact section, and footer. The page header contains the header (<header>), which contains the 
logo, the main menu (<nav>), and the content displayed in the header. The main content of the
page is placed in the <main> tag. It contains the introduction section (<section class="intro">), 
which contains short blocks with information and images, the services section (<section class="services">), 
which lists services with images and descriptions, the About Us section (<section class="about">) which 
contains information about the car service and images, a block with a workflow (<section class="process__container">)
that describes the steps of car maintenance, and a section with contacts (<section class="contacts">),
including a feedback form. The footer (<footer>) contains the copyright and a block with social media icons.
The layout includes the use of containers (<div class="container">) that limit the width of the content to improve 
its visual appearance on different devices. Styling classes (e.g. <div class="header__menu menu"> and 
<ul class="menu__list">) are used to give styles to different elements of the page using CSS. 



CSS:
This CSS code contains style descriptions for various elements of a web page. The main parts of the description
can be divided into sections for the header, introduction, services, about, quick and easy procedure, contacts, 
and footer. The main description of styles starts with resetting the parameters for all elements:

*,
*::before,
*::after {
    padding: 0;
    margin: 0;
    border: 0;
    box-sizing: border-box;
}

This code sets the padding, margin, border, and box-sizing properties to zero for all elements on the page. 
This helps to ensure that the elements on the page are displayed uniformly. The next block of styles sets
common values for the font, text color, font size, and properties for all elements:

* {
  font-family: "Poppins", sans-serif;
  color: black;
  font-size: 20px;
  font-weight: 400;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  border: none;
}

This block sets the font to Poppins, sans-serif for all elements, text color to black, font size to 20px, 
and other common values. The following sections describe the styles for specific sections of the page, 
such as the header, introduction, services, about, fast and easy, contacts, and footer.
Each section contains the corresponding element classes and the corresponding styles for these classes.
